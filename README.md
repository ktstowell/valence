# Valence
A full circle data management solution for Angular.js Apps.

## Version 0.2

This project is so beta even its docs are in beta.

Feel free to play around with stuff and things and contribute!

The DEV branch has the whole working demo. For it you need:

Node, MongoDB, Grunt and patience.

### Installation

    bower install valence

Or fork and run locallly.

You'll notice that master has no package.json, that is because master is not intended for development and is only meant for bower installations. To work with the code from a clone, please checkout the dev branch.

### Known issues

The relational model is in a very fire and fail state filled with exploratory code. The only real problem now is some redundancy in nested models.

There is also some issues when creating Auth roles. See the Author role in the demo.

### The future

Checkout the strategy-refactor branch and read the notes at the top of the Model layer's file to read my latest ideas.
